    <h2>What are drones?</h2>
    <p>An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or Drone) is an aircraft without a pilot or crew passengers.

        UAV(s) are a part/component of UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) where none or semi-human interference is required. The drones may require human assistance by using a remote control, but some Drones have autopilot features.

    <h2 id= "terminolgy">Drone Terminology</h2>
    <p id= "terminolgy_text">The term ‘Drone’ is in use from the early aviations (operations of aircrafts) used during the practice of firing of battleship guns. Examples of such drones: <br> 
        <br> 1. 1920s Fairey queen <br> 2. 1930s de havilland queen bee <br> later examples were Airspeed Queen Wasp and miles queen martinet. <br> in these drones, 1 or more crew passengers, (different in each of the drones) could be seated (optional). 
        <br> <br>
        UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is the term used for Aircrafts which are powered and don’t require human operation and intervention. These aircrafts lift up using Aerodynamic forces. <br>
        <br> The drones and UAVs are in the category of UAS, this term was adopted by the US department if Defence (DoD) and the United States Federal aviation administration (FAA) in 2005 within the accordance to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005–2030 ; ICAO and the British civil aviation authority also adopted this term.

    <h2 id= "classificaton">Classificaton of Drones</h2>
    <P id= classification_text>Lets know about different types of drones<br><br><br>
        1. Single-Rotor Drones<br>These are by far some of the most basic types of drones. As the name would imply, it employs only a single rotor (besides the tail unit in some cases) and can often generate thrust more efficiently than their multi-rotor counterparts. This can make them ideal for longer flight times.<br><br>
        The drones are often not as stable, and while they can still hover over areas, they can also be more difficult to fly than drones that have multiple rotors to keep them balanced and airborne. They can cost anywhere from $25K to a whopping $300K.</P>
    <img src= "1.jpg">
    <p>2. Multi-Rotor Drones<br>Where a single-rotor drone looks like a helicopter and is able to maintain flight with a single rotor, these units have several rotors positioned at strategic points on the craft. These extra rotors can make it easier for the craft to maintain its balance and keep hovering.<br>
        Most types of multi-rotor drones are not able to carry a heavy payload, as this would disrupt the balance maintained by its offsetting rotors. The price varies widely, from $5k for starter units to $65k for top options.</p>
    <img src= "2.jpg">
    <p>3. Fixed-Wing Drones<br>The lack of rotors and fixed-wing style of these drones make them more similar to controllable airplanes rather than the helicopter style of other drones. Rather than rotors, their wings provide vertical lift, which means they only need enough energy to keep moving forward, making them ideal long-range drones.<br>
        The lack of a rotor also makes them harder to land. They must be very carefully brought in for an extremely soft “belly landing,” and in less-than-expert hands, this can go very wrong very quickly. These types of drones generally cost between $25K and $120K.</p>
    <img src= "3.jpg">
    <p>4. Fixed-Wing Hybrid Drones<br>This types of drone attempt to take the best from fixed-wing and rotor-based designs, making for drones that feature both. A fixed-wing hybrid drone will tend to have a couple rotors attached to the ends of fixed wings.<br>
        These units are still rather experimental, and so are far less commercially available than their single-rotor, multi-rotor, and fixed-wing counterparts. However, with several companies developing them, they may well be the wave of the future.</p>

    <img src= "4.jpg">
    <p>5. Small Drones<br>As opposed to the first four drone types listed here, all of which can easily cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, these tend to only cost up to around $100. “Small” in this context typically means between 20 and 80 inches long.<br>
        By contrast, small drones are usually too light and do not have the stability necessary for the picture perfect balance required for accurate picture taking. Nevertheless, these options can be a great inexpensive intro to the world of drones for hobbyists and children.</p>
    <img src= "5.jpg">
    <P>6. Micro Drones<br>While smaller drones may mean recreation in the eyes of consumers, for militaries who use drones, micro drones are all business. The most well-known example of this type of drone in action today is the Black Hornet, manufactured for the British military.<br>
        When they are not in use, Black Hornets can be stored in a special belt. They can fly for up to 25 minutes on a single battery charge, and have a range of up to a mile. In addition, some Black Hornets have been outfitted with infrared cameras.</P>
    <img src= "6.jpg">
    <p>7. Tactical Drones<br>These drones are large enough to not be pocket-sized, while still being far smaller than the type used for general combat and larger tasks. The preferred tactical drone of the US military is the Raven, which measures 4.5 ft and weighs 4.2 lbs.<br>
        The units come with onboard GPS technology. While they are on the simple side and do not boast a lot of bells and whistles, this also makes them quite accessible and easy for soldiers to use without the need for special training.</p>
    <img src= "7.jpg">
    <p>8. Reconnaissance Drones<br>With another military drone class, we once again move up in size a bit to drones that are not designed to be handheld. Instead, these drones measure around 16 ft long, are launched from the ground, and are called Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) or High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones.<br>The drones in question can weigh over 2200 lbs and remain in the air for 52 hours straight at a cruising height of 35,000 ft. The German military makes use of another type of drone, the LUNA, which is less expensive than the Heron, but has shorter operational periods.
    </p>
    <img src= "8.jpg">
    <p>9. Large Combat Drones<br>Chances are when you think of “drones” in a military sense, these are the types you imagine. Variants such as the Predator and Reaper, used by the US, are around 36 ft long and able to fire on targets with air-to-surface missiles and laser-guided bombs.<br>The US may be the most famous (or infamous) user of drones, but they are hardly alone. Fellow NATO nations such as the UK, Spain, and France use them as well, while China has manufactured its own version, the CH-4, which has been bought by Egypt and Iraq.</r></p>
    <img src= "9.jpg">
    <p>10. Non-Combat Large Drones<br>By contrast, there are large drones that are not meant to be used in combat. These can take on a variety of jobs, often reconnaissance, and are used for more large-scale recon missions than their miniscule Black Hornet and Raven counterparts.<br>Just because these drones do not engage in combat does not mean that they are not expensive. The Global Hawk, for example, can cost as much as $131 million, and that does not include ground infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>History of Drones</h2>
    <P>Early Drones: <br> <br> 
        The earliest use of drones in warfighting was observed in July 1849, where the drone served as a balloon carrier in the first ever derogatory use of air forces. The Austrian forces launched their drones with incedenary balloons (balloons carrying bombs with harmful gases) to the besieged city of Venice. Due to sudden change in wind flow, few of the bombs fell in the city but most of them landed back to the Austrian ship, Vulcano. <br> 
        Considerable Development of drones started after the year 1900, originally used to provide practise targets for training the military forces. The developer of the first powered UAV , “Aerial’s Target” was Archibald Montgomery Low (an English Engineer and inventor) who declared that Geoffrey de Havilland’s monoplane was the UAV that flew under control on March 21, 1917 using his radio system. <br> <br> 
        World war- II <br> <br> 
        Drones continued to develop during world war- I, till the Dayton Wright Airplane company invented an air torpedo which could explode at any given time. Nazi germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war, such as- Argus As 292 and the V-1 flying bomb.  <br> <br>
        After war <br> <br>
        The USA, highly concerned and worried about the loss of pilots planned about the use of Unmanned aircrafts. The clash between the American and North Vietnamese navy initiated the use America’s UAVs-Ryan Model 147, Ryan AQM-91 Firefly, Lockheed D-21 into their mission during Vietnam War.
        
        During the War of Attrition (1967–1970) the first tactical UAVs with installed cameras were tested by the Israeli which successfully clicked pictures of the Suez canal. 
        <br> <br> Modern UAVs <br> <br>
        As Drones started developing, maturing and miniaturizing, their demand and interest grew in the US military. DoD gave a contract to AAI Corporation along with Israeli company Malat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed in a partnership. By 2013, at least 50 countries used UAVs. China, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Turkey, and others designed and built their own varieties. The use of drones has continued to increase. No precise list of UAV systems exists because of its various types.

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <h3>There are ways of how to prevent hacking of drones</h3>
        <p>1. If you're using a smartphone or laptop as your controller, keep it secure and don't let it get infected by malware. (In 2012, several US Army drones were reported to have been infected by malware after an operator used a drone's computer to download and play a videogame.) Use anti-virus software, and don't download dodgy programs or apps.<br> <br>
        2. Subscribe to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to stop hackers from accessing your communications when you're connected to the internet. A VPN acts as a secure gateway to the internet and encrypts your connection, so a hacker can't get in.<br> <br>
    3. Set a limit of one for the number of devices that can connect to your base station. That will prevent a hacker hijacking your signal to control other devices.<br> <br>
4. Ensure your drone has a "Return to Home" (RTH) mode. Once you have set the home point, this will enable the drone to return if it loses signal, if your signal is jammed, or if the battery becomes depleted. This will enable you to recover your drone from a hijack situation. However, because RTH depends on GPS to work, it's not immune to GPS spoofing.</p>
<h2>Computer Control</h2>
<p>Sensors<br>
    Position and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state. Exteroceptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements, while exproprioceptive sensors provide the internal and external states.

    Non-cooperative sensors can detect their target autonomously, so they are used for collision avoidance.<br><br>
    Softwares<br>
    Software called the flight stack or autopilot. The purpose of the flight stack is to obtain data from sensors, control motors to ensure UAV stability, and facilitate ground control and mission planning communication.
    UAVs are real-time systems that require a rapid response for changing the data stored in their sensor. That's why, UAVs rely on single-board computers for their computational needs. Eg. Raspberry Pis, Beagle birds,etc.<br><br>
    Communicating system<br>
    UAVs use a radio for control and exchange of video and other data. Early drones had only narrowband uplink. Downlinks came later in time. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator.

    The radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:
    
    Ground control – a human operating a radio transmitter/receiver.
    
    Remote network system, such as satellite duplex data links for some military powers.
    
    Another aircraft, serving as a relay or mobile control station – military manned-unmanned teaming.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<P>There are various civilian, military and aerospace applications for drones :<br><br>
    Military<br>
    With extensive cost reductions and advancements in the UAVs technology, the defense forces around the globe are increasingly using these for various applications.


As of 2020, seventeen countries have armed UAVs, and more than 100 countries use UAVs in a military  capacity.The global military UAV market is run by companies based in the United States, China, and Israel. In accordance with sale numbers, The US holds over 60% military-market share in 2017. <br><br>
Civil applications<br>
Civilian (commercial and general) drone market is run and organised by Chinese companies. Chinese drone manufacturer DJI alone had 74% of the civil market share in 2018 with no other company accounting for more than 5%, and with $11 billion forecast global sales in 2020! Following increased scrutiny of its activities, the US Interior Department organised its fleet of DJI drones in 2020, whereas the Justice Department opposed the use of federal funds for the purchase of DJI and other foreign made drones and Unmanned aerial vehicles.<br><br>
Aerials photgraphy: <br>
Drones are quite suitable for aerial photography and cinematography, and are widely used for this purpose. Small drones avoid the need for extremely precise coordination between pilot and cameraman, with the same person taking on both roles. However, big drones with professional cameras, there is usually a single drone pilot and a camera operator who controls camera angle and lens as well. For example, the AERIGON cinema drone which is used in film production in big blockbuster movies is operated by 2 people only.
